# Algorithm Implementation (Native JavaScript)

This repository focuses on implementing various algorithms and data structures in **vanilla JavaScript** without using any libraries or built-in methods. The goal is to sharpen problem-solving skills and deeply understand fundamental concepts by coding them from scratch.

## Objective

- Implement fundamental algorithms and data structures in JavaScript.
- Avoid using any built-in methods such as `sort()`, `reduce()`, etc.
- Focus on the logic behind each algorithm and how data structures work internally.

## Plan

We will tackle one algorithm or data structure per day. The implementations will be grouped by category, and each implementation will be documented and explained in the corresponding file.

## How to Use

Each algorithm or data structure will have its own JavaScript file. You can navigate through the files to see the implementation details. Comments within the code will explain the logic and key steps for better understanding.
